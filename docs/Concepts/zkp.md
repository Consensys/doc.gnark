# zk-SNARK

A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic construction that allows you to provide a proof of knowledge
(Argument of Knowledge) of secret inputs satisfying a public mathematical statement, without
leaking any information on the inputs (**Zero Knowledge**).

In addition, verifying a proof is a computational operation which is at worst logarithmic in the
size of the mathematical statement (**Succinct**), and the procedure of proving and verifying a proof
requires no interaction between the prover and the verifier, except passing the proof to the
verifier (**non-interactive**).

If we don't consider **Succinctness**, and if we slightly modify the notion of **Zero knowledge**
to **Honest Verifier Zero Knowledge** (which is weaker than the **Zero Knowledge** property), examples
of (HV)ZK-NARK are digital signatures algorithms ECDSA and EDDSA, which are in fact applications of
the Schnorr Identification Protocol. It is essentially an argument of knowledge to prove knowledge
of the discrete log of a point in a group where the discrete log is hard. Verifying such signatures
is not computationally costly, but does not verify the **Succinctness** property as it was previously
defined.

The signature schemes are specific mathematical statements, or [**circuits**](circuits.md).

With `gnark`, you can write any circuit using the [gnark API](../HowTo/write/circuit_api.md).
An instance of such a circuit is $hash(x)=y$, where $y$ is public and $x$ secret.

A valid proof of such a statement ensures that the creator of the proof knows $x$ such that
$hash(x)=y$, without revealing $x$. It is worth noting that if $y$ is not specified, there are an
infinity of couples $(x,y)$ verifying $hash(x)=y$. But if $y$ is specified, only one $x$ verifies
this relation.

## Public and secret inputs

Given a mathematical statement, a zk-SNARK separates the inputs as $public$ and $secret$.
Typically, the $public$ inputs are known to everyone, and there is a unique $secret$ input such that
$secret + public$ inputs satisfy the statement. It's exactly like a signature; given a valid
signature, there is one unique secret key that leads to the signature. However there is an infinity
of valid couples (signature, secret key).

## zk-SNARK activity

zk-SNARK is a very active area of academic research with improvements and new protocols announced
weekly. For example, according to
["A Cambrian Explosion of Crypto Proofs" overview article on Nakamoto.com](https://nakamoto.com/cambrian-explosion-of-crypto-proofs/)
we saw the following new zk-SNARK protocols in 2019: Libra, Sonic, SuperSonic, PlonK, SLONK, Halo,
Marlin, Fractal, Spartan, Succinct Aurora, RedShift, AirAssembly.
