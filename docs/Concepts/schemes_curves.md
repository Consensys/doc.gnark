# Prove schemes and curves

`gnark` supports two proving schemes [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) and [PlonK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf). These schemes can be instantiated with any of the following elliptic curves: BN254, BLS12-381, BLS24-317, BLS12-377, BW6-761, BLS24-315 or BW6-633.

An ID is supplied to `gnark` to choose the proving scheme and the instantiating curve.

## Choosing a proving system

|                   | Groth16                 | PlonK                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| trusted setup     | circuit-specific :star: | universal :star::star: |
| proof length      | :star::star::star:      | :star:                 |
| prover work       | :star::star:            | :star:                 |
| verifier work     | :star::star:            | :star:                 |

Groth16 is best suited when an application needs to generate many proofs for the same circuit (for instance a single logic computation) and performance is critical, while PlonK is best suited when it needs to handle many different circuits (for example different arbitrary business logics) with reasonably fast performance.

### Groth16

Groth16 is a circuit-specific preprocessing general-purpose zk-SNARK construction. It has become a de-facto standard used in several blockchain projects due to the constant size of its proof, and its appealing verifier time. On the downside, Groth16 needs a circuit-specific trusted setup for its preprocessing phase.

:::info

We recommend this short [explaination of Groth16](http://www.zeroknowledgeblog.com/index.php/groth16).

Some projects that use Groth16 include ZCash, Loopring, Hermez, Celo, and Filecoin.

:::

### PlonK

PlonK is a universal preprocessing general-purpose zk-SNARK construction.

It's a proving scheme with a preprocessing phase that can be updated, and has a short and constant verification time. On the downside, PlonK proofs are bigger and slower to generate compared to Groth16.

:::info

For more information, we recommend this [Plonk paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf), and [this Plonk article](https://hackmd.io/@zkteam/plonk).

Some projects that use PlonK include Aztec, ZKSync, and Dusk.

:::

:::note

PlonK comes in different version according to the chosen polynomial commitment scheme. For example:

- [KZG](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf)
- [Pedersen-Bulletproofs](http://web.stanford.edu/~buenz/pubs/bulletproofs.pdf)
- [FRI-based](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1020.pdf)
- [DARK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1229.pdf)

There are also versions for the prover/verifier tradeoff. For example "fast-prover-but-slow-verifier" or "slow-prover-but-fast-verifier" settings.

There are also different optimizations. For example:

- [TurboPlonK](https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-turbo_plonk.pdf),
- [Plookup](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/315.pdf).

Currently, `gnark` supports PlonK with KZG and FRI polynomial commitments.

:::

## Choosing an elliptic curve

Both Groth16 and PlonK (with KZG scheme) need to be instantiated with an elliptic curve. `gnark` supports seven elliptic curves: BN254, BLS12-381, BLS24-317, BLS12-377, BW6-761, BLS24-315, and BW6-633. All these curves are defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ and have an equation of the form $y^2=x^3+b$ ($b\in \mathbb{F}_p$).

To work with Groth16 and PlonK, the curves must:

- Be secure, for proof soundness
- Be pairing-friendly, for proof verification
- Have a highly 2-adic subgroup order, for efficient proof generation.

:::info

BN254 is used in Ethereum 1.x, BLS12-381 in Ethereum 2.0, ZCash Sapling, Algorand, Dfinity, Chia, and Filecoin, and BLS12-377/BW6-761 in Celo, Aleo and EY.

:::

### BN254 and BLS12-381 curves

For applications that target Ethereum 1.x mainnet, BN254 is the only supported curve. EIPs for other curves exist but are not integrated yet:

- [`EIP-2539`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2539)
- [`EIP-2537`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)
- [`EIP-3026`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3026).

For applications that target Ethereum 2.0, use BLS12-381.

For platform-agnostic applications, the choice requires a tradeoff between performance (BN254) and security (BLS12-381). We recommend choosing BLS12-381 as it is more secure, still fast enough to be practical, but slower than BN254.

BN254 was introduced in this [USENIX Security 2014 research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879) and BLS12-381 in this [Electric Coin Co. blog post](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/).

### BLS12-377 and BW6-761 curves

Applications that require one-layer proof composition (a proof of proofs) cannot use BN254 or BLS12-381 as they are quite inefficient for this purpose.

In fact, such an application needs a pair ($E_1, E_2$) of elliptic curves that:

- Are secure, for proof soundness
- Are pairing-friendly, for proof verification
- Have a highly 2-adic subgroup order, for efficient proof generation.
- $E_2$ has a subgroup order equal to $E_1$'s field characteristic, for efficient proof composition.

BLS12-377 and BW6-761 curves satisfy these conditions, while having fast implementations. BLS12-377 was introduced in this [IEEE S&P 2020 research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/962) while BW6-761 was introduced in this [CANS 2020 research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/351).

:::note

Given $E_1$ must have a highly 2-adic field characteristic, BLS12-381 cannot be used.

Some applications that use one-layer proof composition include ZEXE, Celo, Aleo, and Zecale.

### BLS24-315 and BW6-633 curves

In Groth16, elliptic curve operations take place in three different groups: $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_T$, whereas in PlonK (with KZG) operations take place only in $G_1$ and $G_T$. While BN254, BLS12-381 and BLS12-377 are optimized for all the three groups, BLS24-315 is better optimized for $G_1$ only while still competitively optimized for $G_T$. Moreover, it comes in a 2-chain setting with BW6-633 to enable PlonK one-layer proof composition efficiently.

In summary, (BLS24-315, BW6-633) is a pair of elliptic curves that:

- Are secure, for proof soundness.
- Are pairing-friendly, for proof verification.
- Are optimized for KZG-based SNARKs (for example, PlonK).
- Have a highly 2-adic subgroup order, for efficient proof generation.
- For efficient proof composition, BW6-633 has a subgroup order equal to BLS24-315's field characteristic.

These curves were introduced in this [Eurocrypt 2022 research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1359).

### BLS24-317
BLS24-317 is optimized only for $G_1$ and $G_T$ operations (for PlonK-KZG), similarly to BLS24-315 but it does not form a 2-chain. The main difference is that BLS24-317 has a higher 2-adicity i.e. 60 vs. 22 for BLS24-315. It can be seen as the equivalent of BLS12-381 targeted for KZG applications that need to speed up the prover. This curve was introduced in this [DCC2022 research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/586) and its efficiency detailed in this [blog post](https://hackmd.io/@gnark/kzg-bls24)
