# Conditionals and loops

## Loops

Use standard `for` loops inside a circuit definition.

!!! note

    The `for` loop impact on the constraint system is identical to unrolling its content.

!!! example "check that `X*X*X*X*X... == Y`"

    ```go
    func (circuit *Circuit) Define(api frontend.API) error {
        for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
            circuit.X = api.Mul(circuit.X, circuit.X)
        }
        api.AssertIsEqual(circuit.X, circuit.Y)
        return nil
    }
    ```

## Conditionals statements

In an imperative programming language, conditionals would use `if` and `else` statements. However,
this doesn't translate well in a *declarative* API to define the circuit, because the output
of the `frontend.Compile` method is an arithmetic representation that must encode the various
branches.

`gnark` offers `api.Select(...)` API, which is similar to Prolog-like languages.

```go
// Select if b is true, yields i1 else yields i2
func (cs *ConstraintSystem) Select(b Variable, i1, i2 interface{}) Variable {
```

!!! note

    Work is ongoing to provide a `if` like statement. [Github issue](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/issues/81).
